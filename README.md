# Chat App

## Overview

Chat App is a web-based client-server chat application, developed using React for the frontend and potentially Node.js for the backend. It enables users to engage in real-time communication through a user-friendly interface. When a user sends a message, the client-side application captures and sends the data to a server, which then broadcasts it to other connected clients. This architecture ensures quick and efficient data transmission, allowing for live chat experiences. The app may include user authentication for secure access and could support multiple chat rooms or direct messages.
